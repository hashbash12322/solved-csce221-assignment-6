In this assignment we create a graph to represent the direct flights between different departure cities. By combining our previously studied Data Structures, we are able to find any path between any two cities in the least amount of flight connections necessary. The Data Structures we will use are the Graph, Dequeue, Adjacency List, Lists, Queues, Stacks and Unordered Sets ADTs.
